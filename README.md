# webDashboard_Python

- A web dashboard that visualises CO2 levels across different countries over time. Made using the Holoviz package, which
runs Bokeh to deploy the final dashoard to the localhost.

- The Jupyter Notebook has been annotated extensively. Tests of the less intuitive parts of the code can be found at the bottom of the notebook.
